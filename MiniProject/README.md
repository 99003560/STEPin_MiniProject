# Automated Teller Machine

To develop a project for ATM applications of a customer in banking environment which provides various ways to perform banking tasks. The main aim of this project is to develop software for ATM for which it performs some of the functions such as money withdraw, deposit and checking the balance.

This system allows users to login to theirs account, the bank provides a debit card and a unique secret PIN for a user where they can use the card whenever he wants to withdraw or deposit money. Based on the operations carried out by the user, the amount will be deducted/added automatically from/to the available account balance. The system also allows us to check the current balance of our account. These fundamental operations are present in most of the ATM. Most people in this digital world do not use the ATM, but it is used more in rural areas where people are unaware of digital payments. It is part of our life activity, which helps us with day-to-day business and transactions. It enables the users of a bank to have access to their account without going to the bank. It performs some of the functions like withdraw, deposit, check balance and change pin.
